This project aims to extract the data from SQL server and then calculating the Tempreature moving average for my city and compare it with the global tempreature. 


Special Note: 
Riyadh data starts from 1843 but there are two missing columns in 1846 and 1847. So, I started to apply the moving average method starting from 1848. Furthermore, to make a correct comparision I also started to apply the moving average method for the global data starting from 1848 until 2004. I had made every ten years into one interval to make it better to how the temperature is changing.
